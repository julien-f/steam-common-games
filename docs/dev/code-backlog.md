# Code backlog

Code findings from `code-audit` runs, judged against CLAUDE.md's conventions and the docs each dimension names. Severity: **critical** (exploitable, or loses or corrupts data) · **major** · **minor** · **cleanup** (no behaviour change); effort S/M/L. Fix items with the `code-fix` skill; remove an item once it ships.

## Simplify

- **C152 · cleanup · S** — `public/style.css:2142`'s `.panel-tag-playtime` rule styles a class nothing renders (found while fixing C126, outside its ranges). Delete it.

## Correctness

- **C70 · minor · S** — narrowed: a failed refresh now keeps the Updated tile for every kind, but a dynamic or shared list that failed before it ever fetched still shows no tile, since `public/ListRoute.tsx` only renders it without an age for owned, wishlist and comparison lists. Render it for any list built from account sources (walking its sources), as frontend.md's "rendered unconditionally" asks.
- **C91 · minor · S** — a comparison's 🔗 Share view link never applies its layout: `load()`'s compare branch rewrites the URL to `compareUrl(...)` (`public/ListRoute.tsx:2065`), which has no `tv` param, so the replace drops `?tv=` before `takeSharedView` runs at table build. Carry the view param over into the canonical URL (or take it before the rewrite).
- **C124 · minor · S** — on `/rank` the side panel's tag pills look like filter toggles but do nothing, and ↻ Refresh spins without re-fetching the game's details: `RankRoute.tsx:139` opens the panel but registers no `routeHandlers`, so AppShell's `onTagClick`/`onRefresh` relays (`public/AppShell.tsx:200`) no-op. Register the handlers RankRoute can honour (a details refresh), and render tags as plain pills when no route filters them.

## Security

None open.

## Performance

None open.

## Reliability

- **C1 · minor · M** — dependency updates wait on a manual `dependency-audit` run. Dependabot or Renovate could open them, since CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `check` and the e2e suite on PRs, but their PRs lack the `CHANGELOG.md` entry the pre-commit hook requires (CI doesn't check it) and skip `npm run build`, so each still needs a local pass through dependency-audit's Applying.

## Compliance

- **C40 · minor · S** — players `GetPlayerSummaries` omits are never cached (`lib/steam.js` `fetchPlayerBatch`), so a deleted or invalid account in a friends list is re-requested on every load. Cache the omission briefly once it's confirmed Steam omits only ids that really don't exist (not transiently); record that in integrations.md.

## Tests

- **C92 · minor · S** — the F1 "Price card says when ITAD didn't answer" e2e test's route `/\/api\/(health|prices)$/` (`e2e/scenarios.spec.ts:873`) never matches `/api/prices?country=…`, so only the health failure is exercised and the price-lookup failure path isn't. Match the query string too and check the test still fails without the fix it locks.

## Docs

None open.
