# Code backlog

Code findings from `code-audit` runs, judged against CLAUDE.md's conventions and the docs each dimension names. Severity: **critical** (exploitable, or loses or corrupts data) · **major** · **minor** · **cleanup** (no behaviour change); effort S/M/L. Fix items with the `code-fix` skill; remove an item once it ships.

## Reliability

- **C1 · minor · M** — dependency updates wait on a manual `dependency-audit` run. Dependabot or Renovate could open them, since CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `check` and the e2e suite on PRs, but their PRs lack the `CHANGELOG.md` entry the pre-commit hook requires (CI doesn't check it) and skip `npm run build`, so each still needs a local pass through dependency-audit's Applying.

## Compliance

- **C40 · minor · S** — players `GetPlayerSummaries` omits are never cached (`lib/steam.js` `fetchPlayerBatch`), so a deleted or invalid account in a friends list is re-requested on every load. Cache the omission briefly once it's confirmed Steam omits only ids that really don't exist (not transiently); record that in integrations.md.
