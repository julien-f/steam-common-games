# Pitfalls

Surprising behaviors, misleading errors and their fixes. One entry each: symptom first (exact error text when there is one), then cause and fix. Delete entries once obsolete.

- A rule learnt from a pitfall goes in the doc its reader is in (testing.md, frontend.md, ui-guidelines.md, a skill), keeping the exact error text: on an unexpected error, `grep -ri '<fragment>' docs/ .claude/skills/`.

## Dev servers

### `is outside of Vite serving allow list`: a blank page after `npm run dev:mock`

- **Symptom**: the app stays blank; the server logs `The request id ".../node_modules/@solidjs/router/..." is outside of Vite serving allow list`, and the browser gets a 403 for it.
- **Cause**: a page requested Solid's router while Vite was still optimizing dependencies on startup. `node scripts/mock-server.js up` waits for that; a server started by hand doesn't.
- **Fix**: wait a few seconds and reload; the same file is then served (200).

### `dev:mock` serves older CSS or modules

- **Symptom**: a page shows CSS or code older than the file on disk, and a reload doesn't fix it.
- **Cause**: `node scripts/mock-server.js up` restarts a server it started at another git HEAD, but uncommitted edits don't move HEAD.
- **Fix**: `node scripts/mock-server.js down`, then `up`.

### `ReferenceError: <name> is not defined` in the browser console mid-edit

- **Symptom**: the console of a page open on a dev server logs `ReferenceError` for a function that exists, with two `ListRoute.tsx?t=…` versions in the stack.
- **Cause**: hot reload picked up a module between two edits (e.g. a call added before its import).
- **Fix**: reload the page and check again before treating it as a bug.

### `listen EADDRINUSE`: a new `/api` route answers `Cannot GET` under `npm run dev`

- **Symptom**: the page says a source "didn't answer"; `curl localhost:3000/api/<route>` returns Express's `Cannot GET /api/<route>` HTML; the `backend` log says `Error: cannot listen on <host>:3000: listen EADDRINUSE`.
- **Cause**: another worktree's dev server already holds port 3000, so this checkout's backend never binds and Vite proxies `/api` to the other one, which runs older code.
- **Fix**: `node scripts/session-end.js` lists running servers; start this one on a free port with `PORT=3001 npm run dev` (Vite's proxy reads the same `PORT`), or stop the other.

## Tests

### A unit test loads a second copy of a module: `window is not defined`, stale module state, an effect that never re-runs

- **Cause**: a `.ts` module's own `import`s go through Node's ESM loader, while a test's `require` goes through CommonJS: the two keep separate module instances and caches.
- `delete require.cache[…]` doesn't reset a module-level value (a memoized fetch, a counter) of a module that a `.ts` file imports: keep state a test must reset in a factory the test calls (like `createPanelDataCache()`).
- An effect created with `require('solid-js')` runs once and never again on a `public/` module's signal: `require` loads solid-js's CommonJS build, the `.ts` modules its ESM one. Use `await import('solid-js')` (see `test/authStore.test.js`).
- `require('../public/gameColumns.ts')` (or any module importing `@vates/data-table-solid`) throws `ReferenceError: window is not defined`: the library touches `window` when it loads. Resolve it to `@vates/data-table-core`, which provides the helpers, with a `module.registerHooks` resolve hook (see `test/gameColumns.test.js`).

### `TypeError: … is not a function` from the pre-commit hook in a test the commit doesn't include

- **Symptom**: the hook's `test` step fails in a new test file that isn't staged, e.g. `TypeError: needsRestart is not a function`.
- **Cause**: the hook sets aside unstaged edits to tracked files but leaves untracked ones, so a new test for code you haven't staged runs against the old code.
- **Fix**: commit a script and its new test together, and move other changes' untracked tests out of the tree until their commit.

### A tainted-canvas fallback can't be tested through `page.route`

- **Symptom**: an image served by `route.fulfill` without `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` still loads with `crossOrigin = 'anonymous'` and its canvas reads fine, so the "no CORS" path never runs (seen checking the panel tint, `artTint.ts`).
- **Cause**: observed with Playwright's Chromium: a fulfilled cross-origin response passes the CORS check whatever its headers.
- **Fix**: serve the image from a real server on another origin (`python3 -m http.server` on a spare port) and call the code from the page.

## Git, hooks and parallel agents

- Agents in worktrees are fix-batch lanes: their own rules (branch from local `main`, per-lane message files, one command per call) live in [BATCH.md](../../.claude/skills/code-fix/BATCH.md)'s lane template.

### `node_modules is behind package-lock.json` on a merge in the main checkout

- **Symptom**: `scripts/check.js` (the hooks, `npm run check`) stops with `✗ node_modules is behind package-lock.json: <package> (…). Run npm ci.`, though the branch passed.
- **Cause**: worktrees run their own `npm ci`; the main checkout's `node_modules` stays at whatever it last installed.
- **Fix**: `npm ci` in the main checkout, then commit the merge again (it stays staged).

### Another agent's commit shows a branch as merged without its changes

- **Symptom**: `git log --graph` shows someone else's commit with a branch as second parent, but its tree lacks that branch's changes, which are still staged.
- **Cause**: a merge left pending in the main checkout (`--no-commit`, conflicts, or a hook that blocked the merge commit) keeps `MERGE_HEAD`; the next `git commit` there, by any agent, becomes the merge and takes only what that agent staged. Another session may instead abort it (`reset: moving to HEAD` in the reflog, the merge's new files left untracked), even while its own commit runs the hook.
- **Fix**: merge where nobody else commits, as CLAUDE.md's Git workflow says (a temp branch in the worktree, then `--ff-only`); `git merge --abort` one left pending. Once absorbed, commit the staged changes on top, naming the absorbing commit in the message.

### `fatal: this operation must be run in a work tree` after a commit

- **Symptom**: other checkouts fail with that error (`core.bare` turned `true`), stray commits from a test's throwaway repo sit on a branch, or branches you never made appear.
- **Cause**: a test spawned `git` with the hook's `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_INDEX_FILE`, so it acted on the real repo; `npm test` strips `GIT_*` (`test/gitEnv.js`), so the test ran another way.
- **Fix**: `git config core.bare false`, then move the affected refs back with `git update-ref` (their reflogs show the previous commit).

### A `Merge lane …` commit carries another session's backlog edits

- **Symptom**: the merge carries `docs/dev/improvements.md` (or `code-backlog.md`) lines no lane wrote, and that file's uncommitted edits vanish from `git status` in the main checkout.
- **Cause**: a hand `git add` of a whole backlog file during the merge swept in another session's uncommitted edits (`node scripts/batch.js merge` stages only the lane's).
- **Fix**: `git restore --source=HEAD^1 --staged <file>`, then `git commit --amend`: the swept-in edits leave the commit and stay in the working tree.

### Staging one hunk from a patch lands it in the wrong place

- **Symptom**: `pre-commit` fails `format` on lines that look right in the working tree; the staged file (`git show :<file>`) has them inside another function.
- **Cause**: a patch made with `git diff -U0` and staged with `git apply --cached --unidiff-zero` carries no context, so its line numbers count the hunks left out: it applies at the shifted line.
- **Fix**: build the staged content from `HEAD` (`git show HEAD:<file>`, edit, then `git update-index --cacheinfo 100644,$(git hash-object -w <copy>),<file>`), or commit the hunks in the order they sit in the file.

## App

### A closed `[popover]` panel shows anyway

- **Symptom**: a popover panel sits on the page, in flow under its button, before anything opened it; `toBeHidden()` on it fails.
- **Cause**: the browser hides a closed popover with a user-agent `display: none`, which any `display` in the app's CSS (`.account-chip-panel`'s `flex`) overrides.
- **Fix**: set a panel's `display` only while open, `:popover-open { display: flex }`, as `.account-chip-panel` does in `styles/components.css`.

### `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON` from an upstream

- **Symptom**: a `[tag]` warning in the server log with that error, for every uncached game, while cached ones still show.
- **Cause**: the endpoint answered HTML: it was retired and redirects to a home page, or it serves a block page. `fetch` follows redirects, so metrics count the final page's 200. Steam store calls don't follow them: they fail with `Steam store: 302 redirect to …` and count as 302.
- **Fix**: `curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{redirect_url}\n' '<url>'`; then check the upstream's announcements for a replacement.
