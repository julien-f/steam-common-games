# Third-party integrations

Every upstream this app talks to, and what is undocumented about each. Cache tiers and TTLs: [data.md](data.md); request counters and budgets: [observability.md](observability.md); pacing settings: `default.env` and [configuration.md](../user/configuration.md).

**Trust tiers.**

- **Sanctioned**: Steam's keyed `api.steampowered.com` endpoints (among them `ResolveVanityURL` and `GetOwnedGames`, `lib/steam.js`), its key-less `GetAppReviews`, Steam OpenID's `check_authentication` (`lib/auth.js`) and the IsThereAnyDeal API — documented.
- **Untrusted**: everything else here — HLTB's search API, Steam's wishlist/store-search/search-results/store-browse/appdetails/packagedetails/ajaxresolvebundles endpoints, ProtonDB, Fanatical's storefront feed, Microsoft's Game Pass catalog and product catalog. Undocumented, reached without a key (sometimes with spoofed browser headers), not guaranteed sanctioned by their terms, liable to break or be blocked without notice. Usage is low-volume and non-commercial; **don't scale up request volume without revisiting these notes.**
- **Other people use the live site** (steam.isonoe.net), so their Steam IDs and profiles pass through it: attribution and privacy are real requirements, not a local tool's.
- **Circuit breakers** (`lib/circuitBreaker.js`) on the ones that answer a block with a 403 — Steam's store, HLTB's search, ProtonDB: 2 consecutive 403s leave that upstream alone for 5 minutes, including requests already queued when it trips.
- **Pacing**: Steam's store takes 2 requests in flight, each slot pausing `STORE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` before reuse; HLTB's search, ProtonDB, the store browse API and Steam reviews take 3 each, pausing `UPSTREAM_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` — enough to keep pace with the store on a cold load. A store, reviews or HLTB search 429 pauses every request to that upstream for its `Retry-After` (seconds or an HTTP date), uncapped; without one, 2 s doubling per 429 up to 30 s, the requests refused together counting once (`createPause`, `lib/upstream.js`). A store or reviews request is retried at most twice before failing; an HLTB search isn't retried, and every row still waiting on HLTB waits out the pause.

## HLTB — no npm package

The `howlongtobeat` npm package was removed (it pulled in a vulnerable `axios`); HLTB is called directly, untrusted tier, with spoofed browser `User-Agent`/`Referer` headers:

1. `GET https://howlongtobeat.com/api/search/site/init?t={ms}` → `{ token, hpKey, hpVal }`
2. `POST https://howlongtobeat.com/api/search/site` with `X-Auth-Token`, `X-Hp-Key`, `X-Hp-Val` headers and `{ [hpKey]: hpVal, ...payload }` in the body

- **When it breaks**: HLTB renames these endpoints from time to time (they were `api/bleed/*`); recent npm packages such as `howlongtobeat-ts` reverse-engineer the new flow quickly and are the first place to look.
- **Token**: cached in memory for 5 minutes (session-bound, not on disk). A 401/403 from search clears it.
  - A 403, or a 401 on a fresh token (one no search has accepted yet), is a block: it holds off re-init for 30 s, and two in a row trip the breaker.
  - A 401 on a token searches already accepted is expiry: re-init at once. Assumed, not documented: HLTB's real token lifetime is unknown, so a fresh token idle long enough to expire reads as a block: a 30 s hold, or the breaker's 5 minutes when two searches in flight both get the 401.
- **Matching**: Levenshtein similarity (`stringSimilarity`); below 0.35 is discarded.
- **What's searched**: the store metadata's `type` skips soundtracks, videos, series, episodes, hardware, demos and ads (`NOT_PLAYED_TYPES`, `server.js`), which read as no data rather than failed. Tools are still searched: none of the types the app knows (`TYPE_LABELS`) marks them — an assumption from observed data, not Steam's docs.
- **Times** (`pickBestMatch`): `main` (`comp_main`), `extra` (`comp_plus`), `completionist` (`comp_100`) and `all` (`comp_all`), seconds converted to hours rounded to the half hour, as HLTB's own site shows them.
  - `all` ("All PlayStyles") is **not** the average of the other three: it pools every submission regardless of category (`comp_all_count` = the sum of the three counts), so it usually lands near Main Story.
  - Being one representative number, it's the default HLTB column (`hltbAll`, "HLTB (h)"), the ranking card's "10.5 h to beat", and the first figure in the panel's How Long To Beat section.

## Owned games — `GetOwnedGames`' playtime fields

- `playtime_forever` and `rtime_last_played` feed Played and Last Played; `playtime_2weeks` (minutes, sent only when above 0) feeds Compare's **Playing lately** and its **Last 2 weeks** columns. Valve's wiki lists `playtime_2weeks` as minutes played in the last two weeks, from memory: the page answered 403 when checked (2026-10-30), so this is unconfirmed.
- The window is Steam's two weeks before the library's cached copy, which lives up to `LIBRARY_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES`. `/api/common-games` leaves an account out of `recentPlaytime` once its copy is over 14 days old: its two weeks then say nothing about now.

## Wishlist — undocumented endpoint

- `getWishlist` calls `https://api.steampowered.com/IWishlistService/GetWishlist/v1/?steamid={id}` — absent from Valve's published docs, untrusted tier. Works with a plain request and no key (checked 2026-10-10: same answer with or without one).
- A private wishlist, a private profile and an empty wishlist all return `200` with `{"response":{}}` (no `items`), so a missing `items` is treated as an empty wishlist — the cases can't be told apart.

## Friends — documented, keyed endpoint

- `getFriendList` calls `https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetFriendList/v1/?key={key}&steamid={id}` — sanctioned tier. It returns only `steamid`s; names and avatars come from the batched `GetPlayerSummaries` (at most 100 ids per call, Valve's documented limit; larger sets go out as sequential chunks).
- A private friends list gets a `401`, so unlike the wishlist it's distinguishable: cached as `null` (not `[]`), and `POST /api/friends` reports those steamids as `unavailable`.

## Tags & demo link — store browse data

`resolveSteamTags` (`lib/steam.js`) reads the user tags shown on the game's own store page (and so on SteamDB and ITAD), not SteamSpy's separate dataset, which is sparse for niche or recent games. Two undocumented, key-less endpoints:

- `https://api.steampowered.com/IStoreBrowseService/GetItems/v1/?input_json={"ids":[{"appid":N}],"context":{"language":"english","country_code":"US"},"data_request":{"include_tag_count":30}}` — the app's whole store browse item.
  - `tagids` are already ordered by relevance, as the store page shows them; all are shown (20 at most, whatever `include_tag_count` asks).
  - `tags: [{tagid, weight}]` gives the votes behind that order, in the same order. `resolveSteamTags` sends each weight relative to the game's top tag (raw counts don't compare across games, and some top tags are capped at 10000), as `tagWeights` on `/api/game-details`.
  - `extractDemoAppid` reads `related_items.demo_appid` from the same item, shown as the panel's "🎮 Try the Free Demo" banner (`.panel-demo-banner`) rather than in ⋯ More, since a demo is a call to action.
  - The **whole raw item** is cached (`browse:{appid}`), so a new field from it needs only a new extractor, no new request; `fetchGameDetails` reads it once for both.
- `https://store.steampowered.com/actions/ajaxgetstoretags?l=english` — tagid → name, one near-static list of ~430, cached once (`tagnames:all`); the parsed map stays in memory until that row is rewritten or expires.
- A cache key whose value shape changes gets a new prefix rather than reusing the old one: a shape check can't tell an old value from a new one of the same JS type (an empty array, say). Retired keys age out with the TTL sweep.

## Store metadata — appdetails

`getAppDetails` (`lib/steam.js`) calls the undocumented `store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids={id}`, on the store's limiter and breaker.

- **The reply can be keyed under another appid.** Since about 2026-09-24 many games come back as `{"<other id>": {"success": true, "data": {"steam_appid": <requested id>, …}}}`, the key often one of the game's DLCs (e.g. 1656930 → `"3290770"`, 39210 → `"4831120"`). The data is right, only the key is wrong: `getAppDetails` falls back to the entry whose `data.steam_appid` matches the request, so a different game's entry is still rejected. Seen elsewhere too: [romm#4774](https://github.com/rommapp/romm/pull/4774), [EnhancedGV#9](https://github.com/Featherwolf/EnhancedGV/pull/9).
- **Software is typed `game` too** (RPG Maker, a launcher; checked 2026-10-23 over 1,206 cached entries: types were only `game`, `demo`, `advertising`, `mod`). Only its genres tell it apart — Utilities, Design & Illustration, Web Publishing, Game Development seen; Animation & Modeling, Video/Audio Production, Photo Editing, Software Training assumed from the store's genre list — so `tagTaste.ts`'s `isSoftware` reads those.
- The fetch pins `cc=us`, so the launch price `computeProductionTier` reads is always USD ([decisions.md](decisions.md)).
- **Images load browser-direct from Steam's CDN**, never through the server. A game table loads one per row: `capsule_image` (231×87, ~12 KB), falling back to `capsule_imagev5` (184×69, ~8 KB): the larger one costs bytes (×1.5), not requests.
  - The panel reads the open game's capsule once more, in CORS mode, to tint its ground (`artTint.ts`): the CDN answers `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (checked 2026-10-19), so the browser cache usually serves it; without that header the canvas would be tainted and the ground stays neutral.

## Reviews — `GetAppReviews`

- `getGameRating` (`lib/steam.js`) calls the documented, key-less [`IUserReviewsService/GetAppReviews`](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/IUserReviewsService) with `input_json` `{appid, languages: ['all'], purchase_type: 1, num_per_page: 1}` and reads only `response.query_summary` (`total_reviews`, `total_positive`, `review_score_desc`).
- It replaced `store.steampowered.com/appreviews/{appid}?json=1`, which Steam switched off on 2026-10-22: it now redirects every app to the store's home page.
- **Assumption**: `purchase_type: 1` counts every purchase (Steam and keys), like the old `purchase_type=all`. The enum's values aren't in the docs; Portal 2's totals for 1 equal 0 (Steam) plus 2 (non-Steam), and match the old endpoint's cached counts.
- `num_per_page: 0` is ignored (20 reviews, ~16 KB); 1 keeps a response under 1 KB.
- Key-less calls share Steam's lower rate limit and answer 429 past it; only a key tied to the app raises it, so none is sent. Own limiter, no circuit breaker (it doesn't answer 403).
- No reviews (`total_reviews` 0 or absent — an unknown appid answers `{"response":{}}`) is cached as `null`: no data, not a failure.

## ProtonDB — undocumented summary endpoint

`getProtonDbStatus` (`lib/steam.js`) calls `https://www.protondb.com/api/v1/reports/summaries/{appid}.json`: untrusted tier, no key, no headers at all, its own limiter and breaker.

- **404**: no reports yet, cached as `null`.
- **403**: seen as a blanket bot-block (the same page for every appid); the error message carries a body snippet to tell it from a per-game error, and two in a row open the breaker.
- **`tier: "pending"`**: too few reports for a tier, but ProtonDB still publishes a `provisionalTier`; that one is shown, marked `pending: true` so the UI renders it lower-confidence. Only no provisional tier either reads as no data. The raw reply is cached, so this rule can change without busting anything.

## Achievements — keyed `ISteamUserStats`

Documented endpoints whose "no data" answers are error statuses, treated as answers rather than failures:

- **`GetSchemaForGame/v2`** (key): a 403 with a **JSON** body means no achievements (cached as `[]`, on the short miss TTL since a game gets them at release); a 403 with an **HTML** body is a rejected key, a real failure.
- **`GetPlayerAchievements/v1`** (key): **400** means no stats, **403** a private profile; both cached as `null`, like a reply without `playerstats.success`.
- **`GetGlobalAchievementPercentagesForApp/v2`**: **no key** needed. A 403 with an empty body answers both "no achievements" and "unknown appid", cached as `null` on the short miss TTL. `percent` is a numeric string.

## News — `GetNewsForApp`

- `getGameNews` (`lib/steam.js`) calls the documented, key-less `ISteamNews/GetNewsForApp/v2` with `count=20&maxlength=1` and **`feeds=steam_community_announcements`, a parameter Valve's docs don't list**: it keeps only the developer's own posts, the ones the store page shows.
- Without it the reply mixes in third-party press in any language, which can outnumber official posts ten to one — so if Steam drops the parameter, the panel's news fills with that press.

## Looking up an arbitrary game

- **Search**: `GET /api/search-games?q=<term>` (`searchStoreGames`, `lib/steam.js`) wraps `store.steampowered.com/api/storesearch/?term=...&l=english&cc=US`, the endpoint Steam's own store search box uses — untrusted tier, no key. Debounced client-side, and each distinct term costs two upstream calls (`search:` cache): the search, then one batched store browse `GetItems` over its results to drop demos — storesearch types every item `app`, while the browse item's `type` is `1` for a demo (confirmed 2026-10-30 on several searches; `0` game, `4` DLC, `11` soundtrack). If that call fails, demos stay in and the term is cached for `MISS_CACHE_TTL_MS` only. A bare appid or a pasted store URL skips it and goes straight to `/api/game-details`.
- **No ownership check**: `GET /api/game-details/:appid` already serves wishlist games, so any appid works.
- **Never trusts a client-supplied name**: the route resolves the name itself from `getAppDetails(appid)` and searches HLTB with it. A name from the dropdown only avoids a title flash in the panel and is never sent. Cost: HLTB waits for store metadata instead of starting in parallel — a deliberate trade on a public, key-less endpoint.
- Links and the Recently Looked Up list: [frontend.md](frontend.md).

## A developer's or publisher's games — store search results

`searchCreatorGames` (`lib/steam.js`) wraps the store search page's own results feed: `store.steampowered.com/search/results/?{developer|publisher}=<name>&category1=998&infinite=1&count=100` — untrusted tier, no key, not disallowed by `robots.txt`. Nothing sanctioned covers it: `GetItems` only names a game's creators, `IStoreQueryService/Query` silently ignores an unknown filter (returning the whole catalog), ITAD has no creator lookup.

- **Reply**: `{ total_count, start, results_html }`; no match is `total_count: 0, start: -1`. Appids come from each row's `data-ds-itemkey="App_<id>"` — `category1=998` still lets packages through (`Sub_<id>`, base game plus DLC appids), so those are skipped and `total` overcounts slightly.
- **Exact, case-sensitive name**: "Supergiant" or "supergiant games" match nothing. The name `appdetails` gives works as-is (23 checked, including "FromSoftware, Inc.", "ZA/UM", "indie.io"). A publisher spelled differently across its games only matches the games with that spelling.
- **One page, 100 games** in Steam's relevance order: a cold list then costs 1 search call plus ~2 `steam-store` calls per game for its details (~200, ~50 s at the store's pacing, ~4% of `OUTBOUND_HOURLY_MAX`), bounded per client by `STREAM_MAX_PER_IP`. Discovery lists are mostly cold, which is why the cap is one page.
- **In a combined list** (a `developer`/`publisher` source, [lists-and-accounts.md](lists-and-accounts.md#kinds)): at most one search per distinct name, deduplicated and cached like opening that list; details only for the combined result, never more than opening each list. Updated forces every such source, each counted by the `creatorGames` limiter, and a failure fails the whole list, naming the source. A capped source counts its first page only, which the formula line says for a top-level source.
- Rows also carry `data-ds-crtrids` (creator clan ids, as `GetItems`' `creator_clan_account_id`): a name-independent key, unused.

## IsThereAnyDeal

Bundle browsing (`/bundles`, `/lists/bundle/:bundleId`) and every price column come from the [IsThereAnyDeal API](https://docs.isthereanydeal.com/) via `lib/itad.js` — free, key-gated, with published (if sparse) OpenAPI docs: sanctioned tier.

- **Optional**: gated on `ITAD_API_KEY`. `isItadConfigured()` (`server.js`) is checked per request; `GET /api/bundles`, `GET /api/bundles/:id`, `POST /api/bundles/resolve`, `POST /api/prices`, `GET /api/game-bundles/:appid` and `GET /api/game-pass` return 503 when unset, and the frontend hides those surfaces (`GET /api/health`'s `itadConfigured`).
- **Batches of 200 ids** (`BATCH_MAX`) for every multi-id call: documented for `/games/prices/v3` (`gids-200`); an assumption for the two `/lookup/` endpoints, whose docs list no cap.
- **Links are passed through unmodified** — ITAD's terms require prices and links as returned. An opened bundle's hero shows "View on IsThereAnyDeal ↗" (`details`) and "Get this bundle ↗" (`url`, the shop/affiliate link with its tracking params). The one addition anywhere is **Buy on Fanatical**'s `scg=…` parameter ([Fanatical](#fanatical--pick-and-mix-tier-prices)), inside that same link; every tracking parameter is left alone.

### Bundles

- **`GET /bundles/v1`** (`getBundles`, `GET /api/bundles`): current bundles, paginated (`offset`/`limit`, max 50/page), with a `country` param driving currency and (per ITAD, presumably) regional pricing.
- **`mature=true` is always sent**: it's ITAD's _include_ switch, not an "only mature" filter, and the app has no age gate. Defaulting to `false` once hid 33 of 35 active bundles, including ones with no game carrying ITAD's per-game `mature` flag.
- **No single-bundle endpoint upstream**, so `GET /api/bundles/:id` (`findBundleById`) searches: active bundles first (`expired=false`), then expired, up to `BUNDLE_SEARCH_MAX_PAGES` (6) pages of 50 each per state, then 404s. Each page reuses `getBundles`' cache. `fetchBundleById` (`public/bundleData.ts`) always calls this route, never the `/bundles` picker's possibly different list.
- **Tiers**: `tiers[]` are price-ascending, and a game can appear in several; `flattenBundleGames` (`public/bundleData.ts`) dedupes by ITAD game id, keeping the cheapest tier.
  - Confirmed on cached data (38 bundles): each tier lists only the games it adds. Some bundles list every game under the first tier and leave pricier ones empty (e.g. 16599, TrineVerse Triple Co-op Pack: €10.55 / €14.77 / €18.99, all 5 games in the first); the last tier with games then shows a range up to the priciest empty tier (`tierPriceMax`, also from `extractGameBundles`), since which tier holds which game is unknown. An empty unpriced trailing tier is ignored.
- **A `null` tier price is not free.** In practice it's Fanatical's "Build Your Own ⟨N⟩ Bundle": one tier, a pool of 15–30 games, priced by quantity. A free or pay-what-you-want tier would carry `{amount: 0, …}` (never observed yet).
  - When Fanatical's feed has the bundle, its quantity tiers stand in ([Fanatical](#fanatical--pick-and-mix-tier-prices)); otherwise `cheapestTierPrice` (`BundlesBrowseRoute.tsx`) and `renderTierPrice` (`ListRoute.tsx`) render "Varies"/"Price varies", keeping "Free" for `amount === 0`.
  - The `tierPrice` column uses `compareNumMissingLast`, or `null` would sort as 0 — every Build Your Own game first under the default ascending sort.
- **`GET /games/bundles/v2`** (`getGameBundles`/`extractGameBundles`, `GET /api/game-bundles/:appid`): the bundles one game is in, for the panel's Price card.
  - Verified live: full `/bundles/v1`-shaped objects, current only unless `expired=true` (one game: 1 by default, 8 with it).
  - appid → gid reuses `resolveItadIds`; cached raw per (gid, country) as `itad-gamebundles:`.
  - Each line shows the cheapest tier holding the game; a pick-and-mix tier shows its best quantity rate ("from €1.17/game", `withPickAndMix`), "Varies" when Fanatical's feed lacks it.
  - Assumption: a game ITAD maps only via a Steam sub counts as in the bundle — ITAD matches by gid, passed through.

### Resolving bundle games to Steam

Bundle games carry only an ITAD id (uuid), slug and title. `resolveSteamAppIds` (`lib/itad.js`, `POST /api/bundles/resolve`):

1. Steam's ITAD shop id via `GET /service/shops/v1`, by title (`getShopId`, `itad-shop:steam`).
2. The game ids through **`POST /lookup/shop/{shopId}/id/v1`** — not the `/lookup/{shopId}/gid/v1` the sibling endpoints' naming suggests; ITAD's convention is `/lookup/{lookup-what}/{by-what}/`, confirmed against the live API. Each shop id comes back namespaced: `"app/<id>"` (a store page, used directly), `"sub/<id>"` (a package) or `"bundle/<id>"` (a Steam bundle page).
3. **`sub/` and `bundle/` are expanded, not misses** (`expandSteamShopId`), through two more untrusted, key-less Steam endpoints (`lib/steam.js`):
   - `GET /api/packagedetails?packageids=<id>` (`resolveSteamPackageAppids`): usually one title with no `app/` page of its own (confirmed live on "Garbage Dwellers Bundle") → one appid.
   - `GET /actions/ajaxresolvebundles?bundleids=<id>` (`resolveSteamBundleAppids`): usually a real multi-item package (confirmed live: Steam bundle 4995, EVERSPACE - Ultimate Edition → base game + 2 DLC) → an array.
   - `resolveSteamAppIds`/`resolveBundleAppids`/`resolveBundleGames` (`public/bundleData.ts`) carry `number | number[] | null` through; an array becomes one row per appid sharing the gid's metadata. Cached as `steampkg:`/`steambundle:`.
   - This is the one place `lib/itad.js` calls into `lib/steam.js`, since a Steam package's contents are Steam's data.
4. **`GET /games/info/v2`'s `appid` is the last resort**, only when a `sub/`/`bundle/` expansion comes up empty. Never for a gid with no shop entry at all: every live case with an `info/v2` appid also had a `sub`/`bundle` entry, and `info/v2` has no batch form, so it would spend a request per ebook or soundtrack. At most 3 at once.

- Still nothing → `null`, as for a game with no Steam listing. A lookup that _failed_ rather than came up empty is left uncached, retried on the next resolve, and listed under `failed` instead of `appids`, so the bundle page says Steam didn't answer rather than "not on Steam".
- Each gid's resolution is cached individually (`itad-appid:{gid}`), so a game seen in one bundle is never re-resolved for another.
- `/bundles` resolves every active bundle's gids on each visit with an account (its Wishlist / New to you columns): ~3 ITAD lookups and one Steam package lookup per `sub/`/`bundle/` gid (~1% of them, measured on a dev `db.sqlite`) on a cold cache, none once cached; expired bundles aren't resolved.

### Prices

**`POST /games/prices/v3`** (`getPrices`/`extractPriceInfo`, `POST /api/prices`) supplies the price columns, per ITAD game id and `country`:

- **`historyLow.{all,y1,m3}`**: the lowest price across every shop ITAD tracks, not Steam-only.
  - **It includes undiscounted prices.** The docs don't define it in prose; their sample response shows a deal with `cut` 0 and `regular` 9.99 beside `historyLow.m3` 9.99. So `dealRecordTier` (`public/utils.ts`) awards no record tier when the best deal has no discount (`bestDealCut` 0, or a price at or above Steam Full Price).
- **`deals[]`**, each shop's current `price`/`regular`/`cut`/`url`. `extractPriceInfo` reads it twice: the Steam shop's entry for its `regular` (Steam Full Price), and the lowest `price.amount` across all for `bestDeal: {price, shop, url}` — `url` lets the panel's Price card link straight to the deal. One response is all in the requested currency, so no conversion is needed.
- **Discount is computed against Steam Full Price, not ITAD's `cut`.** `cut` is each shop's discount off its own regular price, inconsistent across shops; `discountPct` (`public/utils.ts`) computes `1 − bestDeal/steamRegular` against the one stable reference. No clamping needed: Best Deal includes Steam, so it's never above Steam's price. `extractPriceInfo` doesn't surface `cut` at all. `renderCut` shows 0 as "—".
- **Cached per (gid, country)** (`itad-price:{country}:{gid}`): a price differs per region, not just its currency label.
- **One route for bundles and wishlists**, since only the identifier differs: a bundle sends `gids`; a wishlist (or a saved or shared list built from one or from a bundle, `listHasPriceSource`) sends `appids`, which the route resolves first via `resolveItadIds` — `POST /lookup/id/shop/{shopId}/v1`, confirmed live: takes `["app/<appid>", …]`, returns `{"app/<appid>": "<uuid>"|null, …}` keyed by what was sent. Each appid is cached individually (`itad-gid:{appid}`), a confirmed miss included. Exactly one of `gids`/`appids`, else 400. No route exposes appid → gid, since nothing needs the raw gid.
- **Chunks**: the server caps a call at `MAX_PRICE_LOOKUP_GAMES` (500), and `loadPrices` (`ListRoute.tsx`) chunks to match, sequentially — a wishlist can exceed it, a bundle never does.
- **A bundle's prices load concurrently with its details stream**: pricing has nothing to do with ratings/HLTB/tags.
- **A failed call** (rate limit, upstream error) sets every row's price fields to `null` ("—", not the loading "…") and says so in the list's price status line (`loadPrices`).
- **Default columns**: Best Deal and Discount visible; Steam Full Price (named so it reads as the list price), All-Time Low, Best Deal Shop, 1yr Low and 3mo Low hidden — Best Deal + Discount already answer "is this a good deal".

### Currency is passed through, not converted

- A tier or game price is in whatever currency ITAD's upstream shop charges; most shops (Humble, GreenManGaming, most Fanatical bundles) switch per region, but some only ever price in USD (verified live: a shop ITAD lists as "Digiphile", and at least one Fanatical bundle). That's upstream behavior, noted beside the region picker, not something to convert away.
- So a row keeps **two currency fields**: `tierCurrency` (from the bundle's tier data, Tier Price only) and `priceCurrency` (always set from the price response, the other five price columns). One shared field once mislabeled USD tier prices with the region's symbol, or the reverse, depending on which request answered first. `formatMoney(v, currency)` (`public/utils.ts`) is called by `renderPrice` (`gameColumns.ts`) and `renderTierPrice` (`ListRoute.tsx`) with their own field.

### Rate limiting

- `BUNDLES_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` backs six limiters — `bundlesListLimit`, `bundlesByIdLimit`, `bundlesResolveLimit`, `pricesLimit`, `gameBundlesLimit`, `gamePassLimit` — each `skip`ping a request it can answer from cache by rebuilding that route's cache key (the same pattern as `detailsLimit`). Without the skip, reloading a bundle page a few times would 429 a genuinely new bundle open.
- `pricesLimit` checks `itad-price:` for whichever of `gids`/`appids` was sent, plus `itad-gid:` for `appids`.
- `bundlesByIdLimit` can't skip — `findBundleById` walks a variable number of pages — so it gets twice the budget instead; its pages are still cached underneath.

## Fanatical — pick-and-mix tier prices

- **Why**: ITAD lists a Fanatical "Build your own" bundle as one tier with `price: null`; the real pricing is by quantity ("pick 5 for €5.99, 10 for €9.99…").
- **Source**: `GET https://www.fanatical.com/api/all/en` (`lib/fanatical.js`) — the storefront's own undocumented, key-less feed: untrusted tier. Fanatical has no public API; its sanctioned product data is the CJ affiliate feed, which needs an affiliate account. The per-bundle `/api/pick-and-mix/<slug>/en` answers a scripted request with `403 Request blocked`, so it isn't used.
- **Volume**: one call serves every bundle, whichever route asks (`/api/game-bundles` included). Only the `pickandmix[]` slug → `{tiers, products}` map is kept (`products`: each pick's `name` and `slug`; the feed is ~800 KB), cached as `fanatical-pnm:v2`. A slug missing from a map over an hour old triggers one re-fetch (a bundle that went live since). A failure keeps the previous map (or an empty one) for an hour, logged once per attempt — never an error to the client.
- **Matching**: exact, by slug. ITAD's purchase `url` for these bundles is an affiliate redirect wrapping `fanatical.com/<lang>/pick-and-mix/<slug>` (`pickAndMixSlug`). Only bundles whose `page.name` is `Fanatical` and that have a null-price tier are enriched; expired ones drop out of the feed and stay "Varies".
- **Shape**: `GET /api/bundles`, `GET /api/bundles/:id` and `GET /api/game-bundles/:appid` add `pickAndMix: [{ quantity, prices: { EUR: 5.99, … } }]` (minor units converted, quantity-ascending). Every currency is passed through; the frontend picks the region's, else USD (`pickTiers`, `public/bundleRows.ts`), the same fallback as a USD-only ITAD shop.
- **Names**: `GET /api/bundles/:id` (not the list) also adds `pickAndMixNames: { <ITAD gid>: <Fanatical name> }` (`matchPickAndMix`), in order:
  1. by slug, then normalised title;
  2. a title Fanatical extends with a subtitle ("Dead Finger Dice" → "Dead Finger Dice: A Billionaire Killing Game");
  3. a shared base title before " - "/" + "/":" ("Insurmountable - Supporter Bundle" ↔ "Insurmountable + Supporter Pack");
  4. when both lists are the same length and one game and one product are left, they're paired ("The Pixel Pulps Collection" is "Classic Adventure Triple Pack").
  - Steps 2–3 apply only when exactly one unclaimed product fits. Measured on the 11 live bundles: 217 of 217 matched. Anything unmatched shows as "N to pick by hand".
- **Buying the selection** ("Buy N on Fanatical ↗", `public/fanaticalPicks.ts`):
  - **The basket can't be filled from this app**: `POST /api/basket` on fanatical.com is keyed to that site's `anonid` header (from its storage) or login token, so a cross-origin request is blocked and a server-side one fills a basket nobody sees; no deep link pre-selects.
  - **The link** (`fanaticalBuyUrl`): ITAD's link with `scg=<JSON array of names>` added to the Fanatical address inside Awin's `ued`, every other byte unchanged. Awin redirects to `ued` and appends its `utm_*`/`awc` with `&`, so both arrive. A URL cleaner that skips Awin and opens `ued` directly also keeps it (losing the referral). A fragment on the outer link survived Awin but not such a cleaner — hence inside `ued`. Fanatical keeps the unknown parameter through its own page load.
  - **The bookmarklet** (**Add to Fanatical**, `addFanaticalPicks`, self-contained in the `javascript:` URL, nothing loaded from this app) reads `scg` from the query (or a fragment) and clicks each named card's own **Add** button (`article.PickAndMixCard`, matched on its `img[alt]`; `button.select-btn` gains `btn-selected` once in the basket), so Fanatical's own client sends the request with its own attribution.
    - It waits for each add to show. A game already in the basket can render unselected while the basket loads, so a click removes it; it clicks again.
    - A **SOLD OUT** card keeps a working-looking Add button that adds nothing; the bookmarklet reports it instead of clicking (the feed carries no stock, so the app can't say so in advance).
    - It runs only because Fanatical sends no Content-Security-Policy. Verified live through ITAD's Awin link (10 adds 500 ms apart all held). Depends on that markup: a redesign breaks it until updated.
- **Frontend**: [frontend.md](frontend.md#each-list-kind-in-practice) — tier chips, the per-game Tier Price, the selection's cost (`cheapestPicks`).
- **Pricing rule** (confirmed by the maintainer): any number of games can be picked, each at the per-game rate of the largest tier reached — 6 games at "5 for €5.99" cost 6 × €5.99 / 5. `cheapestPicks` also considers rounding up to a larger tier when its price is lower.
- **Assumptions** (unconfirmed against Fanatical's checkout): below the smallest tier, that tier's price is the minimum; the total is rounded to the cent, not each game's price.

## Xbox PC Game Pass — catalog feed

`GET /api/game-pass?country=` (`lib/gamepass.js`): the Steam games in PC Game Pass, plus the ones not on Steam by name.

1. **Catalog**: `GET https://catalog.gamepass.com/sigls/v2?id=fdd9e2a7-0fee-49f6-ad69-4354098401ff&language=en-us&market=<country>` — the "All PC Games" collection xbox.com's PC Game Pass page lists. Undocumented, key-less: untrusted tier. The first entry describes the collection; the rest are `{ id }`, Microsoft Store product ids.
   - **Varies by market** (checked 2026-10-26: US 516 ids; FR identical; DE and BR 2 fewer; JP 24 fewer and 4 of its own), so it follows the app's region and is cached per market (`gamepass:pc:<country>`).
   - An empty or unparseable catalog is an upstream error, never cached as an empty Game Pass.
2. **Product ids → ITAD gids**: `POST /lookup/id/shop/{shopId}/v1`, the Microsoft Store shop looked up by title (`getShopId('Microsoft Store')`, `lookupShopGids`). The reply also keys ids lowercased (seen live), so they're matched case-insensitively. Several product ids (editions) map to one gid: each game counts once. Cached with the catalog.
3. **Gids → Steam appids**: `resolveSteamAppIds`, as for [bundles](#resolving-bundle-games-to-steam). Checked 2026-10-26 on US: 516 ids → 511 gids → 467 on Steam (482 appids: a Steam package expands to its games), 47 ids not on Steam.
4. **Names of the games not on Steam** (no gid, or a gid with no Steam listing): `GET https://displaycatalog.mp.microsoft.com/v7.0/products?bigIds=<ids>&market=<country>&languages=en-us&fieldsTemplate=browse` — Microsoft's product catalog, undocumented, key-less: untrusted tier. 100 ids per call; `browse` is the smallest template carrying `ProductTitle` (~13 KB per product). Cached per product (`msstore-title:`); a failure logs `[gamepass]` and degrades to the bare id.

- **Volume**: one catalog call and one ITAD lookup per market per `BUNDLES_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES`, plus titles for newly seen non-Steam products (1 call on a cold US cache).
- **Failure**: a gid whose Steam lookup errored is counted in `failed` (uncached, retried next time), not reported as not on Steam.
