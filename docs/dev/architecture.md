# Architecture

An Express backend (`server.js` + `lib/*`, plain CommonJS JavaScript) serving a Solid.js single-page app (`public/*`, TypeScript, bundled by Vite). The backend is a caching proxy over Steam/HLTB/IsThereAnyDeal/ProtonDB/Fanatical; accounts, lists and preferences live in the browser's `localStorage`, and the server stores them only for a signed-in user who syncs (`users`, `sessions`, `user_prefs` — [data.md](data.md)).

- [frontend.md](frontend.md) — the SPA: shell, routes, module map, reactivity rules
- [lists-and-accounts.md](lists-and-accounts.md) — the account/list data model the frontend is built around
- [integrations.md](integrations.md) — every upstream, and what's undocumented about each
- [data.md](data.md) — `db.sqlite`, cache tiers, refresh paths
- [observability.md](observability.md) — `/api/metrics`, budgets, proactive log warnings
- [decisions.md](decisions.md) — computed values (Weighted Rating, Production Tier), tooling choices, and why

Setup and dev commands are in [README.md](../../README.md); tests and hooks in [testing.md](testing.md).

## Build and serving

- `npm run build` (`vite build`) bundles `public/`'s two HTML entries into `dist/` (gitignored): `index.html`, the SPA, and `present.html`, the presentation window's own page (served as a static file, none of the SPA in it). `server.js` serves `dist/` when `dist/index.html` exists, else `public/` raw — which browsers can't run (TypeScript), so a fresh clone needs a build before `npm start`.
- In dev, Vite (`npm run dev:frontend`, `root: 'public'`) serves the sources and proxies `/api` to Express on `:3000`. Its port is pinned (`server.port`/`strictPort`): a different port is a different origin, so a fallback port would reset localStorage, cookies and sign-in.
- `publicDir: '../static'`: `static/` holds the files copied into `dist/` as-is (the link-preview image and PNG icons); `public/` is source, so it can't be Vite's default `publicDir`.
- **Behind the live reverse proxy** (Caddy): it gzips HTML, JS and JSON, and sets HSTS, `nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` and `Referrer-Policy: same-origin` (checked 2026-10-31). `server.js` does neither, except the details stream's own gzip, so a bare `npm start` serves uncompressed.
- **SPA fallback**: routes are real paths (`/lists/owned`, `/game/440`), so `server.js` ends with a catch-all (`app.get(/^\/(?!api\/)(?!.*\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+$).*/)`) sending `index.html` after the API routes and static files, with Open Graph tags injected for chat link previews (crawlers don't run the SPA); `/game/<appid>` names and describes the game and shows its header image when its details are cached, never fetching them. Vite's dev server does the fallback by itself, without the tags.

## Backend modules

- **`server.js`** — Express setup and route handlers only; all upstream work lives in `lib/*`.
- **`lib/config.js`** — loads `.env` over `default.env` and exports the TTLs, budgets, session lifetime and upstream pacing shared across modules.
- **`lib/db.js`** — opens `db.sqlite` and applies its append-only `MIGRATIONS` ([data.md](data.md)).
- **`lib/cache.js`** — persistent cache over `db.sqlite` (`getCached`, `setCache`, `isCached` for limiter skips, `getCacheEntryCounts` for health and metrics); `createCachedFetch` binds a module's dedup into its `cachedFetch(key, { force }, load)`, the cache-then-dedup skeleton of a single-key upstream getter.
- **`lib/dedup.js`** — `createDedup`: concurrent calls for the same key share one promise.
- **`lib/steam.js`** — Steam Web API and store calls (`resolveSteamId`, `getOwnedGames`, `getWishlist`, `getFriendList`, `getPlayerSummaries`, `getGameRating`, `getAppDetails`, `getStoreBrowseItem`, `resolveSteamTags`, `extractDemoAppid`, `searchStoreGames`, `getGameNews`, …), ProtonDB, and their per-host semaphores (`storeLimit`/`tagLimit`/`protonLimit`/`reviewsLimit`).
- **`lib/hltb.js`** — HLTB auth + search (`getHLTB`), behind its own semaphore (`hltbLimit`).
- **`lib/itad.js`** — IsThereAnyDeal calls (`getShopId`, `getBundles`, `resolveSteamAppIds`, prices) behind bundle browsing and every price column.
- **`lib/fanatical.js`** — Fanatical's storefront feed, for pick-and-mix tier prices ([integrations.md](integrations.md#fanatical--pick-and-mix-tier-prices)).
- **`lib/gamepass.js`** — the PC Game Pass catalog as Steam appids ([integrations.md](integrations.md#xbox-pc-game-pass--catalog-feed)).
- **`lib/upstream.js`** — `createSemaphore` (concurrency cap + per-slot pacing, registered for `GET /api/metrics`) and `upstreamError`, shared by the upstream clients.
- **`lib/circuitBreaker.js`** — one 403-storm breaker per blocking-prone upstream (Steam store, HLTB, ProtonDB).
- **`lib/metrics.js`** — `createTrackedFetch`, outbound budgets and the counters behind `GET /api/metrics` ([observability.md](observability.md)).
- **`lib/auth.js`** — Steam OpenID 2.0 sign-in (each assertion accepted once, within 5 minutes of its nonce), cookie sessions and per-key user prefs, behind `/auth/*` and `/api/me*`.

The dedup map, semaphores, breakers and metrics are process-local: correct for the single-process deployment, but several instances would each get their own and multiply upstream traffic silently.

## Tooling

- **`tsconfig.json`** — `strict`, `noUnusedLocals` (dead imports fail the typecheck), `noEmit`, `moduleResolution: bundler`, `verbatimModuleSyntax` (type-only imports use `import type`), over `public/**/*.ts`; `paths: {"/*": ["./public/*"]}` maps the browser-style absolute imports (`'/utils.ts'`) onto the source tree. `tsconfig.e2e.json` extends it over `e2e/`. The compiler is TypeScript 7 (`tsgo`).
- **`eslint.config.mjs`** — `eslint-plugin-solid`'s `flat/typescript` rules only, parsed by `@babel/eslint-parser` ([decisions.md](decisions.md#linting-babel-not-typescript-eslint)). `solid/reactivity` is the rule that matters ([frontend.md](frontend.md#reactivity)). `.mjs` because `package.json` has no `"type": "module"`.
- **Prettier** (`.prettierrc.json`) formats the whole tree.

Rate limits ([observability.md](observability.md), [data.md](data.md)):

- Every route that can reach an upstream, plus the auth routes and the prefs write, is behind a named `express-rate-limit` instance.
- Most `skip` requests they can answer from cache. Always counting: `bundlesById` (a looser budget instead), `auth` (a fixed `max: 20` in `server.js`), and the stream route (its array body defeats `details`' per-appid skip).
- A middleware after the JSON body parser runs each request under its client's key (`clientKey`, the limiters' key) in an `AsyncLocalStorage`, so the outbound calls it makes are charged to that client's share of the outbound budgets ([observability.md](observability.md#outbound-budgets)).
- No limiter: health, metrics, `GET /api/me`, logout, `/opensearch.xml` and the SPA shell (cache-only, no upstream call).

## Request flow

1. Frontend POSTs `{ members: ["alice", "bob_family"] }` to `/api/common-games`: one account, or a Steam Family's member accounts, whose libraries are unioned. A comparison makes one call per player and combines them in the browser.
2. Server resolves every identifier to a Steam64 ID, deduplicates, fetches all libraries in one parallel pass, unions them, and returns `{ games, players, playtime, lastPlayed, recentPlaytime, fetchedAt }`:
   - `players[]` carry each account's `gameCount`, shown next to it without a second request.
   - `playtime`/`lastPlayed`/`recentPlaytime` are keyed by appid then by the member who owns it; `recentPlaytime` is Steam's two-week playtime, left out for an account whose cached library is older than that window.
3. The frontend renders rows at once, then POSTs the appids to `POST /api/game-details/stream` (SSE) for rating, HLTB, store metadata and tags over one connection. It leaves out screenshots and trailers: an opened game loads its own from `GET /api/game-meta` ([frontend.md](frontend.md#rows-streaming-and-stale-loads)).
4. The stream route works the list through a bounded worker pool (`STREAM_CONCURRENCY`) pulling from a shared cursor, fully cached games first (behind uncached ones they'd wait on the upstreams' pace), checking the client is still connected before each appid — dispatching every appid up front would make that check unreachable and let one request fill the shared semaphore queues ahead of everyone else's. It's gzipped when accepted (~2.5 KB per game, a fifth gzipped) and flushed per event. A client past `STREAM_MAX_PER_IP` open streams gets a 429, so parallel streams can't fill the shared store queue.
