# Configuration

All settings live in environment variables. `default.env` (committed) lists every one with its default and an explanation — it is the reference; this page covers what you actually need to set.

Create `.env` (gitignored) with only the values you want to override:

```
STEAM_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

- **`STEAM_API_KEY`** — the only required setting. Get one at <https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey>. The server exits at startup with a clear message if it's missing.
- **`ITAD_API_KEY`** — optional, enables bundle browsing, every price column and the PC Game Pass list. Without it those surfaces are hidden, with a line saying why, and the rest of the app runs normally. Get one by registering an app at <https://isthereanydeal.com/apps/my/>.
- **`HOST`/`PORT`** — where the server binds; `127.0.0.1:3000` by default. `npm run dev` proxies to them too.
- **`TRUST_PROXY`** — set it (usually `1`, the number of proxy hops) when running behind a reverse proxy, so rate limits apply per visitor and link previews and sign-in use the proxy's `https`. Unset by default.
- **`DB_FILE`** — path to the SQLite database (`db.sqlite` by default). Set it empty to run entirely in memory.

Everything else in `default.env` is a limit or a lifetime with a sensible default:

- **Rate limits** (`*_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`, `MAX_USERS`, `STREAM_MAX_GAMES`, `STREAM_CONCURRENCY`, `STREAM_MAX_PER_IP`) — per-client request budgets, how much work one request may queue, and how many game lists one client may load at once.
- **Outbound budgets** (`OUTBOUND_HOURLY_MAX`, `OUTBOUND_DAILY_MAX`) — a hard ceiling on requests this app makes to each third-party service per hour and per day, protecting an API key's quota no matter how many clients are asking. `0` disables.
- **Client share** (`OUTBOUND_CLIENT_SHARE_PERCENT`) — how much of each outbound budget one client (an IP address, or an IPv6 /56) may spend, so one visitor can't use it up for everyone; past it, that visitor's new lookups are refused until the window rolls over. `0` disables.
  - A cold library costs about one call per game not yet cached to each service (Steam store, Steam reviews…), so a client's share covers about `OUTBOUND_HOURLY_MAX × share` such games an hour.
  - Behind a reverse proxy without `TRUST_PROXY`, every visitor is the proxy's address: they all share one client's share.
- **Upstream pacing** (`STORE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, 500; `UPSTREAM_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, 1000) — the pause before a request slot is reused: Steam's store, then HLTB, ProtonDB and Steam's store browse API. Leave them: lowering them raises traffic to undocumented endpoints.
- **Cache lifetimes** (`*_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES`) — how long each kind of upstream data is kept. They're generous on purpose; every screen that shows cached data says how old it is, and the age itself is the button that fetches fresh.
- **Session lifetime** (`SESSION_TTL_DAYS`) — how long "Sign in with Steam" lasts before signing in again.

`npm run cache:clear` empties every cache table without deleting the database.
