//   store page displays them in), plus other fields riding along on the exact same response
//   for free, e.g. `related_items.demo_appid` (see extractDemoAppid below). One call per game.
//   The raw item is cached whole (`browse:{appid}`) rather than just the extracted tagids,
//   same "cache raw, extract at read time" approach used everywhere else in this file — so
//   adding another field this call already returns (like the demo link) never needs a new
//   upstream request, just a new extractor over the same cached response.
// - `ajaxgetstoretags` (store.steampowered.com) maps every tagid to its human-readable
//   name — a single, near-static ~430-entry list, not per-game, so it's fetched once and
//   cached long-term (`tagnames:all`, in the same meta TTL group as `browse:`) rather
//   than repeated for every game.
