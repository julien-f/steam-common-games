// Recently looked-up games — carved out of gameSearch.ts (see docs/list-centric-redesign.md's
// Phase 1) so this storage layer is separate from that file's combobox/debounce UI, and so it
// can back a new first-class, browsable "Recently Looked Up" system list (/game, see
// ListRoute.tsx) rather than only ever being a dropdown convenience feed. Repointed at prefs.ts's
// shared blob (the 'recentGames' key) instead of its own standalone localStorage key — one more
// preference the same future per-key server sync (see prefs.ts) can reach, same reasoning every other
// preference here already follows. No migration from the old standalone key: this whole feature
// is part of a full frontend replacement (see docs/list-centric-redesign.md's own "no migration"
// decision) — an existing user's recent-games history just resets once.
//
// Unlike accountsStore.ts's recentAccounts (namespaced per account, uncapped, soft-removable
// while referenced by a dynamic list), a game looked up via search means the same thing
// regardless of which page/list it was looked up from, so this stays one flat, capped,
// hard-removable list — nothing here can be a dynamic-list *source's own dependency* the way an
// account or another user list can (a "recent-games" ListRef just reads this list directly, see
// listResolve.ts), so there's no soft-delete concern to carry over.
