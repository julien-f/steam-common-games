// Batches high-frequency row mutations (an SSE detail stream, one event per game) so a page's
// table doesn't fully re-sort/re-filter/re-paginate once per streamed game. Extracted after a
// real regression: `library.tsx`'s own hand-rolled version of this (a `pendingDetailEvents`
// queue + `flushTimer`) was written to fix a confirmed browser-freezing bug — a ~1150-game
// library took up to a minute of unresponsive main-thread work to finish streaming, because
// `@vates/data-table-solid`'s `tableData()` accessor reacts live to the row store, so every
// *unbatched* mutation (one per streamed game) triggered a full table recompute instead of one
// per flush. The pre-Solid `@vates/data-table-vanilla` table got that amortization for free via
// an explicit, timer-gated `table.setData()` call; the Solid conversion dropped it silently
// since there was no more `setData()` call left for the timer to gate — nothing enforced the
// relationship between "a debounce timer exists" and "it's actually gating the expensive part."
//
// Pulling the batching itself into a shared, tested primitive — rather than leaving each page's
// own streaming loop to reinvent (or forget) it — is the structural fix: `bundles.tsx` had the
// identical gap with no batching at all (bundles are usually small enough that nobody noticed),
// and any future streaming consumer gets correct behavior by using this instead of writing its
// own loop.
//
// Deliberately NOT folded into `rowStore.ts`'s `mutateRow` itself — `mutateRow` also backs
// one-off calls (a single achievements load, a DLC toggle, a "↻ Refresh" click) that need to
// apply immediately, not wait out a flush window. Batching only belongs on the specific
// high-frequency path (a streaming loop), which explicitly opts into it via this module instead.
