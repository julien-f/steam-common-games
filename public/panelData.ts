// The side panel's own per-game async data — news, achievements, price, DLC — as plain
// fetch-and-cache functions with no reactivity of their own. panel.tsx wraps each of these in a
// `createResource` keyed on whichever game is open (see its own "Reactivity model" comment), so
// nothing here needs a notion of "the open game".
//
// This replaced panel.tsx's own loadNews/loadAchievements/loadPrice/loadDlc, which each wrote
// their result onto the `Game` object the panel had been handed (`game.news = data.news`,
// `game.priceLoading = true`, …). That single habit is what forced everything else about the
// panel's old reactivity model: a Solid store proxy rejects a direct property write, so the
// panel could only ever be given a deliberately plain *copy* of a store-backed row
// (rowStore.ts's old `panelRows` map), and since a plain object's field writes are invisible to
// Solid, showing anything they fetched needed an explicit `renderPanelBody()` bump — which
// re-rendered the entire panel body, not the one field that changed. Keeping this data off the
// row entirely is what let all of that go; see docs/dev/frontend.md's Reactivity section.
//
// Each result is cached for the session, keyed by appid (plus the account, where the result is
// account-specific), so reopening a game already seen doesn't refetch — the same guarantee the
// old `game.news !== undefined` row-field guards gave, just held here instead of on the row.
// A cached value is returned *synchronously* (see sessionCached): createResource resolves a
// non-promise return with no pending state at all, so a reopen paints the real card immediately
// instead of flashing its loading skeleton again.
//
// The cache is written as soon as a fetch resolves, even for a game the panel has since moved on
// from — a createResource discards a superseded result, but the request was already paid for, so
// the next open of that game should still be instant. This is also what replaces the old
// `if (panelGame() === game)` staleness guards: nothing here can render anything, so a late
// resolve has nothing to race with.
//
// A factory plus a default instance, same shape (and same testability reasoning) as
// myOwnership.ts's createMyOwnershipCache.
