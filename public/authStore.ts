// drifting apart after their one and only sync.
//
// A device's *first ever* sync with a given account is treated differently from every sync after it:
//
//   - First sync: local never overrides a key the server already has, no matter its timestamp —
//     only server → local for anything both sides have, since a brand-new device's local
//     `updatedAt` might just be leftover anonymous-browsing clutter with a coincidentally recent
//     timestamp, not a considered edit competing with whatever's already configured on the
//     account. A key the server has never seen at all still pushes up — that's contributing new
//     data, not overriding existing configuration, so nothing is lost.
//   - Every sync after that: plain last-write-wins, per key, both ways — by then this device has
//     proven itself a real sync participant, so its timestamps are trustworthy signals of actual
//     edits (including retrying a push that failed on a previous attempt).
//
// Equal timestamps are left alone — indistinguishable from "already in sync".
//
// Returns whether anything was adopted from the server and every adoption was kept — the caller
// reloads in that case (a partial one would reload into another first sync, forever), since
// every store (accountsStore, listsStore, ...) seeds its in-memory state from localStorage once
// at load; live-patching each of them to notice an external write isn't worth it for something
// that, once merged, won't differ again until the next real edit on either side.
//
// Exported for unit testing (see test/authStore.test.js) — same reasoning as
// autoPopulateAccountFromLogin's own comment below.
